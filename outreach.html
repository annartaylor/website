								<h1>Outreach</h1>
								<p>My outreach efforts have been dedicated to empowering girls in STEM and fostering inclusivity within the scientific community.
                                     Recognizing the challenges faced by women in fields like physics, I have committed myself to creating opportunities for young 
                                     girls to see themselves represented and supported in STEM. These efforts have been aimed at breaking down barriers and addressing 
                                     the underrepresentation of women in science, encouraging the next generation to pursue their passions without hesitation.</p>

        <h3>Early Outreach Efforts</h3>								
        </div>
        <p>My efforts towards this goal started early. In my senior year of high school, as part of my senior project, I wrote and illustrated a children’s 
            book about a young girl who liked science and looked up to her mother, who was a scientist. This book was entitled Mikayla’s Dream, and I printed 
            and distributed it to all 10 elementary schools in my hometown, reaching over 5,000 students, intending to increase the representation of women in
             STEM and reach young girls with that representation.</p>

        <h3>Undergraduate Involvement</h3>								
        </div>
        <p>During my undergraduate years, I served as Vice President of NCSU’s Women in Physics Club, where  I focused on fostering supportive spaces for women in STEM by 
            organizing career talks, social events, and panel discussions to promote connection and access to valuable resources. I also participted in various outreach events
            such as speaking in reserach panels and being a mentor to REU students.</p>
        </div>


            <h3>Current Mentorship Roles</h3>								
        </div>
        <p>Currently, I am a mentor at the Arizona Science Center’s Girls Who STEM events. I have the privilege of guiding young girls through their own uncertainties and self-doubt, 
            providing them with the support and encouragement they need to pursue their passions in STEM, and I have mentored over 40 young women. I am also currently a STAR Lab mentor, 
            where I advise the research of a high school student mentee. My primary responsibilities in this role are meeting with my students weekly, reviewing their written work, 
            and guiding them in their research goals. I have also participated in other various outreah events in my graduate career, including giving talks to Women in Physics clubs, 
            serving on panels at CUWiP conferences, and presenting at STEAM Nights at local elementary schools. </p>
