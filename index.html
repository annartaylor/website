										<h3>About Me</h3>
										
										<p> Welcome! I am a second year Graduate Student at the Lunar and Planetary Labratory at the University of Arizona.
											 I am currently investigating the He I triplet absorption at 1083 nm in hot escaping exoplanet atmospheres to understand
											trends in the transit depths and make connections to mass-loss. During my undergraduate career, I did research under
											 Dr. John Blondin at my alma mater North Carolina State University using the VH-1 Hydrocode to simulate astrophysical flows specficially
											 modelling the high-mass X-ray binary Vela X-1. I also did research with the Exoplanet 
											 and Stellar Astrophysics Lab at NASA Goddard as part of an internship where I used the PHOENIX atmopsheric code to compute sythetic
											  stellar spectra in an effort to find correlations between stellar parameters and chromospheric emission lines.

 <p style="color:white;">My research at the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Labratory under 
	Dr. Tommi Koskinen is focused on trying to model the He I 1083 nm absorption line that has been observed 
	on many exoplanets known to have escaping atmospheres. We use 
	an atmospheric escape model that is multi-species and solves time-dependent coupled equations of continuity, 
	momentum and energy self consistently. We then use a radiative transfer model to simulate transit depths to compare with observations. Read more in our paper on HD209458b in the Astrophysical Journal below!</p>

							<p style="color:black;">My research at NASA Goddard under Dr. Sarah Peacock and Dr. Allison Youngblood was focused on a search for 
								correlations between photospheric parameters of main sequence stars and the Mg II k self-reversal depth. Published literature values for the 
								intrinsic stellar parameters vary widely for our sample of 142 FGKM stars, so I used the PHOENIX atmosphere code to compute models for 
								each target and consistently determine these parameters using archival photometry as empirical guidance. We then modeled the Mg II k line for each 
							star in the sample to retrieve the self-reversal depths and did a statisitical analysis to identify trends. Read more in our paper in the Astrophysical Journal below!</p>

																			study shocks and gas flow in astrophysical objects on the stellar scale. This research ranges from idealized 
																			problems such as Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion and the spherical accretion shock instability to detailed studies
																			of specific astronomical objects. I worked on the astrophysical flow of Vela X-1, an eclipsing high-mass X-ray 
																			binary (HMXB) system. I worked on analyzing the effects of differing wind speed and Roche Lobe geometries 
																			have on the formation of wind accretion disks in this particular binary system. <a href="https://youtu.be/yR39SPfYRIg" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">Watch my YouTube Abstract here!</a></p>

							<p style="color:black;">I am dedicated to fostering inclusivity and representation in STEM, with a focus on empowering young girls. 
								My outreach journey began with writing and distributing a children’s book, Mikayla’s Dream, to inspire interest in science among over 5,000 students. 
								During my undergraduate years, I served as Vice President of the Women in Physics Club at NCSU, where I organized career talks and social events to support women in STEM. 
								Currently, I mentor over 40 young women through the Arizona Science Center’s Girls Who STEM program, providing guidance and encouragement. 
								I also advise high school students in research through the STAR Lab, meeting with them weekly to review their work and help achieve their research goals. 
								Additionally, I actively participate in panels and outreach events, including CUWiP conferences and STEAM Nights, to inspire the next generation of scientists.</p>
